A computer engineer designs and develops computer systems and other technological devices. The Computer Engineering course teaches how to prototype and test microchips, circuits, processors, conductors and other components used in computer devices or systems. It also teaches how to develop firmware, an essential type of software that allows operating systems and applications to take full advantage of the hardware.\n\n==> A computer hardware engineer researches, designs, develops and tests computer systems and components such as processors, circuit boards, memory devices, networks and routers. Software engineering teaches how to build everything from small circuits to large systems. This branch of engineering trains students to design, construct, and repair any digital system.

In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others. It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.\n\n==> Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century; however, its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world. In the 19th century, developments in physics led to the development of mechanical engineering science. The field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements; today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in such areas as composites, mechatronics, and nanotechnology. It also overlaps with aerospace engineering, metallurgical engineering, civil engineering, structural engineering, electrical engineering, manufacturing engineering, chemical engineering, industrial engineering, and other engineering disciplines to varying amounts.
